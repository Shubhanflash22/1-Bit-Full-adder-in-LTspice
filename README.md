# 1-Bit Full Adder

### Analog & VLSI Design (Nov 2022 – Dec 2022)

This project focuses on designing a complete 1-bit full adder at the transistor level using CMOS logic, starting from basic gate-level construction and progressing to modular adder design.

## Overview

A full adder adds three input bits (A, B, Cin) and outputs a Sum and Carry. The design was built hierarchically—first constructing a half adder using fundamental logic gates, then combining two half adders to form the full adder.

## Work Done

* **Designed a 1-bit full adder** by connecting **two half adder symbols** along with an OR gate for carry propagation.
* **Constructed the half adder** using **NAND, NOR, and inverter gates**.
* **Implemented NAND, NOR, and Inverter gates at the transistor level** using static CMOS (PMOS + NMOS) design principles.
* Ensured proper sizing and transistor-level optimization for propagation delay and power efficiency.

## Result

A fully functional transistor-level 1-bit full adder built using CMOS logic, demonstrating understanding of digital logic, gate-level design, and VLSI fundamentals.
